# Frontend Developer Test – Product Card

I built a responsive Product Card component using real data from `fakestoreapi.com`. Each card displays product details, supports variant selection, and conditionally shows an “Add to Cart” or “Out of Stock” button. The layout is built mobile-first using Bootstrap, and filtering logic is implemented for product categories.
